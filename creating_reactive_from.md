What is a Reactive Form?
A reactive form is just an HTML form thatâ€™s been wired up with RxJS to manage it's state as a realtime stream.
This means you can listen to changes to it's value as an Observable and react accordingly with validation errors,
feedback, database operations, etc

FormControl - An individual form input, checkbox, select, textarea, etc.
FormGroup - A group of form fields that can be manipulated and validated together.
FormBuilder - A service that helps you build FormGroups easily.
